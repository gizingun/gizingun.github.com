- RxSwift is a library for composing asynchronous and event-based code by using observable sequences and functional style operators, allowing for parameterized execution via schedulers.
- RxSwift, in its essence, simplifies developing asynchronous programs by allowing your code to react to new data and process it in a sequential, isolated manner. (more clear?)


#### Introduction to asynchronous programming

- All the different bits of your program don’t block each other’s execution.
- Writing code that truly runs in parallel, however, is rather complex, especially when different bits of code need to work with the same pieces of data.


#### Cocoa and UIKit Asynchronous APIs

- Apple has provided lots of APIs in the iOS SDK that help you write asynchronous code

> NotificationCenter,  `delegate` pattern,  Grand CEntral Dispatch,  Closure

- Since most of your typical classes would do something asynchronously, and all UI components are inherently asynchronous (대부분의 UI 코드는 사실상 모두 비동기)
- It’s impossible to make assumptions in what order the entirety of your app code will get executed (사실상 모든 코드는 비동기 이기 떄문에 전체 코드의 실행순서를 정확히 가정하는 것은 불가능[os상태, 네트워크 상태 등의 외부적인 요인도 영향을 끼침])

#### Synchronous code

var array = [1, 2, 3]
for number in array {
  print(number)
  array = [4, 5, 6]
}
print(array)
